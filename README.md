# Wiki Wars
### A project for Electron's 23:00:01 Hackathon

## Introduction

Wiki wars is our take on the Wikipedia game where the challenge is to navigate from one Wikipedia article to another in the least clicks or the least amount of time, using entirely links within Wikipedia. The project was done as part of Electron's 23:00:01 Hackathon, a 23 hour and one second hackathon.

## Technology used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- AngularJS
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- MediaWiki's API

## Design Goals

As the hackathon was 23 hours, we decided to make a web app for playing the Wikipedia game, a game we were all familiar with, but also one where we would have potential to expand upon depending on how fast we worked on it.

The current edition is what we achieved with a team of 3 in that time. 

## Upcoming additions (maybe?)

- Ability to log in and save a list of your games
- Sending games via game IDs for others to play
- Better article filtering
- Ability to make curated games for others to play
